# Code Buddy


![Code Buddy mockup images](assets/readme-files/responsive-views.png)

The D&D Campaign Party is a website created to allow users to Create a campaign (A party with a minimum of 3 players to a maximum of 8 players) and then Book a venue where they can host their Campaign. This website would typically be used by players that do not have the accommodation for all the people in their campaign.

Users will also be able to view all the upcoming campaigns that the users have created. The user will not have to log in or create an account to view these campaigns, however, the user will have to create or login to an account to book a venue.

If the user have created an account, they will have access to creating a campaign, booking a venue. The users will also be able to view, edit and delete the campaigns and venues that they have created.

### Skeleton

#### Wireframes

[Invision](https://www.invisionapp.com/) has been used to showcase the appearance of the site and display the placement of the different elements within the pages. It is an alternative of the typical Balsamic that Code Institute recommends, personally, I like InVision a little more since I'm used to using it in everyday life.

### Surface

#### Color Scheme

![Color scheme image](assets/readme_files/color_scheme.png)

The colors used in the website are a teal blue color (#3F778D) for secondary buttons, navbar links, as well as for main buttons and links transitions. Charcoal (#253A47) is used for the main text, footer background, main buttons and secondary buttons and links transitions.

A platinum (#E9EDE9) for the navigation bar and card footers background, footer and buttons content. A baby powder color (#FFFFFD) is also used in the main background and cards footer as well as for input fields.

The colors are were chosen keeping in mind simplicity but also providing the website a modern design. This in order to keep the focus on the content but also appealing for the users.


#### Typography

The main font being used in the site is Nunito, with sans-serif as a fallback in case Nunito doesn't get imported correctly. Roboto, with sans-serif as a fallback is used mainly for headings and the logo has been given the Quicksand font, with sans-serif as a fallback.

Nunito and Roboto were chosen after some research on fonts that are better for reading. Specially Nunito which has been used as main font. Quicksand was used for the logo for design purposes.

## Deployment

This project was developed using a [GitPod](https://gitpod.io/) workspace. The code was commited to [Git](https://git-scm.com/) and pushed to [GitHub](https://github.com/") using the terminal.

### Deploying on Heroku
To deploy this page to Heroku from its GitHub repository, the following steps were taken:

1. Create the Heroku App:
    - Select "Create new app" in Heroku.
    - Choose a name for your app and select the location.

2. Attach the Postgres database:
    - In the Resources tab, under add-ons, type in Postgres and select the Heroku Postgres option.

3. Prepare the environment and settings.py file:
    * In the Settings tab, click on Reveal Config Vars and copy the url next to DATABASE_URL.
    * In your GitPod workspace, create an env.py file in the main directory. 
    * Add the DATABASE_URL value and your chosen SECRET_KEY value to the env.py file.
    * Add the SECRET_KEY value to the Config Vars in Heroku.
    * Update the settings.py file to import the env file and add the SECRETKEY and DATABASE_URL file paths.
    * Update the Config Vars with the Cloudinary url, adding into the settings.py file also.
    * In settings.py add the following sections:
        * Cloudinary to the INSTALLED_APPS list
        * STATICFILE_STORAGE
        * STATICFILES_DIRS
        * STATIC_ROOT
        * MEDIA_URL
        * DEFAULT_FILE_STORAGE
        * TEMPLATES_DIR
        * Update DIRS in TEMPLATES with TEMPLATES_DIR
        * Update ALLOWED_HOSTS with ['app_name.heroku.com', 'localhost']

4. Store Static and Media files in Cloudinary and Deploy to Heroku:
    - Create three directories in the main directory; media, storage and templates.
    - Create a file named "Procfile" in the main directory and add the following:
        - web: gunicorn project-name.wsgi
    - Go to Deploy tab on Heroku and connect to the GitHub, then to the required recpository.
    Click on Delpoy Branch and wait for the build to load. When the build is complete, the app can be opened through Heroku.

### Forking the Repository
